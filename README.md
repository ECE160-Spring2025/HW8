Please follow the instructions carefully. Note: failure to do so will result in a reduction of 20% of this homework grade. If you make a mistake, you can always delete the entire repo and try again (but of course, save your code).

2. Create a team (individual or a pair).  
3. Clone the repository to your unix environment and work on the main branch.
4. Write your proposal with sufficient details in a file in the github.
